        PyTango 7.1.2 is out!

    2010-08-02:
          Checkout the new PyTango companion: 
          :ref:`spock` (an IPython_ based tango CLI)

PyTango is a python module that exposes to Python_ the complete Tango_ C++ API.
This includes both client and server API.

This means that you can write not only tango applications (scripts, CLIs, GUIs) 
that access tango device servers but also tango device servers themselves, all 
of this in pure Python_.

Check out the :ref:`getting started guide<getting-started>` to learn how to
build and/or install PyTango and after that the :ref:`quick tour <quick-tour>` 
can help you with the first steps in the PyTango world.

If you need help understanding what Tango itself really is, you can check the
Tango_ homepage where you will find plenty of documentation, faq and tutorials.
